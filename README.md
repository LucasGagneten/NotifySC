Hey developer, hey user.

What is NotifySC?
========
NotifySC is the best solution for users and developer to work with notifications in android. The user can easily control the notification access with that app and can be sure that no private data will get in bad hands. The developer just need 5 minutes to get the first notification on his/her activity with only one java class. It is so easy to setup and to use.
